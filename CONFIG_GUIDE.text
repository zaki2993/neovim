NEOVIM CONFIGURATION GUIDE
==========================

This file explains your custom Neovim setup. Reference this when you forget shortcuts or where files are located.

--- QUICK REFERENCE ---
Leader Key: Space Bar (<Space>)

Most used commands:
- Open File Explorer:  <Space> + pv
- Run Code:            <Space> + r   (Runs Python, C, C++, Java, Dart)
- Search in File:      <Space> + s
- Search Project:      <Space> + pS
- Save File:           <Space> + w

--- FILE STRUCTURE ---
Your config is split into modules. Here is where everything lives:

1. MAPPINGS (Keybinds)
   File: lua/zaki/remap.lua
   - Go here to change shortcuts or add new key combinations.
   - Contains the "Run Code" logic and Tmux integration.

2. PLUGINS (Installation)
   File: lua/zaki/packer.lua
   - Go here to install new plugins.
   - Add use 'plugin-name' inside the startup function.
   - Run :PackerSync after making changes.

3. PLUGIN SETTINGS (Configuration)
   Folder: after/plugin/
   - Individual files for each plugin's specific settings (e.g., lsp.lua, telescope.lua).

--- KEY BINDINGS CHEAT SHEET ---

[ Navigation ]
s           : Search for a pattern and jump to it (Custom "Flash" like movement)
Ctrl + j    : Scroll half-page DOWN
Ctrl + k    : Scroll half-page UP
gg          : Go to the very first character of the file
G           : Go to the very last character of the file
<Esc> (Ins) : Exits Insert mode and moves cursor one right (standardizes position)

[ Coding & LSP ]
< (Key)     : Hover documentation (Show info about function/variable under cursor)
<Space> + fa: Code Actions (The "lightbulb" menu for fixes)
<Esc>       : Closes floating windows (like hover docs) automatically

[ Tmux Integration ]
<Space> + fr  : Reloads the program in Tmux Window 2 (sends 'r')
<Space> + fhr : Restarts the program in Tmux Window 2 (sends 'R')

--- CODE RUNNER ---
Command: <Space> + r

How it works:
- It saves the file first.
- Detects the file type (Python, C, C++, Dart, Java).
- Opens a small split terminal at the bottom.
- Compiles (if needed) and runs the code.

--- HOW TO ADD A NEW PLUGIN ---
1. Open lua/zaki/packer.lua
2. Add a line: use('author/plugin-name')
3. Save the file (:w).
4. Run command: :PackerSync
5. Restart Neovim.
